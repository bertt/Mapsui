# Samples
There are quite a few samples in Mapsui. Run the WPF sample app ([Mapsui.Samples.Wpf](https://github.com/pauldendulk/Mapsui/tree/master/Samples/Mapsui.Samples.Wpf)) in the samples folder to see them in action. Check out the [Samples\Mapsui\Mapsui.Samples.Common\Maps](https://github.com/pauldendulk/Mapsui/tree/master/Samples/Mapsui.Samples.Common/Maps) folder for the source of the samples.
